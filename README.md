# CRAG Policy Exceptions Tool

This is a tool intended to handle requests the Research Computing team get for higher storage quotas, long or dedicated queue access, or shared storage pools.

It used to be in the shared `go-clustertools` repository, but it was split out to make it easier to develop and test.
